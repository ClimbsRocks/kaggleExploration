A list of questions that would be fun to ask of the data

1. Do people get better over time (measured as relative ranking compare to other submissions within the same dataset, or measured as within X% of the top score)

2. How much of a delta is there for the top teams on the public leaderboard to the private leaderboard at the end?

3. Typicaly, how close are the top 20% of answers to the 10th best answer? Basically, I have a feeling that many people can get to within just a few percent of the best relatively trivially. And then from there it seems like we're all spending a disproportionate amount of time possibly overfitting the training data to eke out a fraction of a percentage point more accuracy. 

4. How much better is the best answer than the second best, or the 10th best?

5. How many people have been successful at many different types of competitions?

6. Do people tend to join more teams over time, or fewer?

7. Do people tend to make more submissions over time, or fewer? Maybe they start off all excited, then once they've got their legs under them, they dabble in competitions but don't engage as deeply. Or maybe there's less debugging to be done :)

8. How good are submissions to old competitions? Is it relatively trivial to beat the state of the art from 3 years ago?

9. If a person entered the competition on time, do they keep giving submissions after the contest has ended?
